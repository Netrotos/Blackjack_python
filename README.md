# Blackjack_python
Blackjack cards game coded by a beginner, in addition to file with modifications associated with greeen computing, as I intend to instal this "game" in my graphic calculator.
Update: Fixed bugs and added graphic calculator version more compact and fixed one error
Note: Best version (less bugs) is the "blackjack_graphic calculator.py"
